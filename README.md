# ACCIDENT DETECTION USING IoT

ABSTRACT:

Road accidents continue to be a serious threat to human life, particularly in isolated or high speed areas where timely assistance is often delayed. 
This project present an IoT based solution designed to automatically detect accidents and alert emergency services in real time. 

Once an accident is suspected, the system triggers a countdown timer(eg. 30 sec) during which the user can cancel the alert if itâ€™s a false alarm, if the alert is not cancelled within the given time. 
The system sends an SMS alert to predefined emergency contacts. 
This ensures accurate and immediate response even when the victim is unconscious or alone. 

The system is developed by making it a low-cost, scalable and effective solution for enhancing road safety. By integrating real-time detection, automated alerts and accurate location tracking.
This smart system reduces emergency response time and increases the chances of saving lives.
