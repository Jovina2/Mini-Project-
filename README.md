# SAFE RIDE NOTIFY-ACCIDENT DETECTION USING IoT

ABSTRACT:

Road accidents are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, especially in remote or high-speed areas where immediate help is often unavailable.

To reduce the delay in emergency response, this project proposes an IoT-based accident detection system that automatically identifies vehicle accidents and alerts emergency contacts, medical services, and police in real time. 

Once an accident is detected, a countdown timer allows the user to cancel the alert in case of a false trigger. If not canceled, the system sends the location and time details to a central web server. This data is then displayed on a live dashboard and shared with emergency contacts through SMS or email.
